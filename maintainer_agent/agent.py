        "1. **Get Commit Information** - First, analyze the commit to understand what changed\n"
        "2. **Create Tracking Issue** - Create a GitHub issue with detailed commit information\n"
        "3. **Check Eligibility** - Analyze if the commit contains changes that can/should be ported\n"

        "   - **If ELIGIBLE:** Continue with the porting process:\n"

        "   - Use `get_commit_diff` to analyze the commit and gather information about changed files\n"

        "3. **Check Eligibility**:\n"
